### More Info
 
The only Input file require is the Dx6.tdl and i've included this file within the package.

If you try to make it run and it tell you that 'User Type Not Defined..' kind of mess its because you

didn't add the reference to the DX6.tlb file library, to do so :

Go in the Menu 'Project' Then 'References' select the DirectX6 type library, and if don't see it then click browse and locate the file DX6.tlb included in the package.
